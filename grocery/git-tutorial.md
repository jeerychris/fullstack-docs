## Distributed

One of the nicest features of any Distributed SCM, Git included, is that it's distributed. This means that instead of doing a "checkout" of the current tip of the source code, you do a "clone" of the entire repository.

**Multiple Backups**

This means that even if you're using a centralized workflow, every user essentially has a full backup of the main server. Each of these copies could be pushed up to replace the main server in the event of a crash or corruption. In effect, there is no single point of failure with Git unless there is only a single copy of the repository.

### Any Workflow

**Subversion-Style Workflow**

**Integration Manager Workflow**

> Another common Git workflow involves an integration manager â€” a single person who commits to the **blessed repository**. A number of developers then clone from that repository, push to their own independent repositories, and ask the integrator to pull in their changes. This is the type of development model often seen with open source or GitHub repositories.

**Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow**

> For more massive projects, a development workflow like that of the Linux kernel is often effective. In this model, some people **lieutenants** are in charge of a specific subsystem of the project and they merge in all changes related to that subsystem. Another integrator (the **dictator**) can pull changes from only his/her lieutenants and then push to the 'blessed' repository that everyone then clones from again.

## Staging Area

Unlike the other systems, Git has something called the "staging area" or "index". This is an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.

One thing that sets Git apart from other tools is that it's possible to **quickly stage some of your files and commit them without committing all of the other modified files** in your working directory or having to list them on the command line during the commit.
